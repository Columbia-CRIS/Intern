## Entropy, IIT and Network Metrics
*In case of questions please contact Abhishek Sivaram (as5397@columbia.edu)*

List of folders:

 **Spring 2018** - The codes from the folder are created by Meir Retter (smr2215@columbia.edu). Primarily looking at Von-Neumann Entropy and Integrated Information in Networks

**Evaluator** looks at analyzing properties of various networks, given their architecture

`DataTest.py` runs the evaluator codes for various data sets

The Data is obtained from [Network Repository](http://networkrepository.com)
- Go to the site
- Search for **bio-celegans-dir** for the main test file for the code

#### Current status and things to do
- [ ] Try for other datasets
- [ ] Make `networkx` read any `.edges` file

#### Packages required
- `numpy`
- `networkx`
- `collections`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
