# CRIS Lab - Fall 2018

## Expectations from the interns

- [X] Weekly Meetings will be held to understand the progress of each student

- [X] Weekly **progress report**

- [ ] End of the semester expected **report** and **presentation**


## Adaptive Complex Networks
### Goals (will be updated regularly)
- [ ] Robustness and Efficiency, network entropy translates to Robustness/Efficiency of networks

- [ ] We aim to understand this parallel between Efficiency and Robustness, and Entropy of networks â€“ by applying this to certain biological systems.

 - [ ] Genetic algorithm -- analytical framework for predicting different structures given the relative importance of efficiency and robustness

 - [ ] Genetic algorithm - We are also looking at scale-up of the complex networks work.

## Weekly Goals
- [ ] Read papers mentioned
- [ ] Search for networked datasets from biological and chemical examples


## Deep Learning

### Goals (will be updated regularly)
- [ ] It is expected that the student take sample datasets from http://deeplearning.net/datasets/ (from each subcategory), trains them and does analysis based on their trained model

 - [ ] Sensitivity study on the input layer -- Change the input layer node values to see how the output behaves. This will tell you the important nodes as well.


 - [ ] The weight distribution was hypothesized to follow a power law distribution, which shall be studied as well.
